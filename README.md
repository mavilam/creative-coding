# mavilam's creative-coding
This where I'll store my creative code learning attemps.

## Where do I start?
For now, the framework that I'm learning is [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and the book [Nature of code](https://natureofcode.com) by [Daniel Shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

## Structure
There will be a directory for each experiment. In each directory will be an index.html and a .js file with the p5.js code.
